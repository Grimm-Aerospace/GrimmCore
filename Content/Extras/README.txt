Table of Contents
-----------------

BDBContractsFix - increases max simultaneous contracts, so that Apollo mission and others show up

BDBCryoTanks - replaces BDB boiloff with CryoTanks boiloff (now part of BDB)

BDBKerbalismScienceUpdate - adds (some) missing Kerbalism science definitions for BDB. Work in progress.

CNCJNSQStations - adds CommNetConstellation ground station definitions for JNSQ. Now part of JNSQ. Known issues: 1) Do not change default Ground Station enable/disable settings in base/KK settings pages as it bugs out CNC. 2) Stock Kerbin DSN names appear in flight for some stations, this is just a visual issue and has no gameplay consequences.

Historian - my config for Historian (needs Historian, merge with its folder)

KFLateRepulsors - moves Kerbal Foundries repulsors to a new 4000 science node in Community Tech Tree

KPBSMKSCentrifuge - changes Kerbal Planetary Base Systems nuclear centrifuge to behave like the one in MKS

ShowAllTechTreeNodes - make sure to show all tech nodes regardless of other mods configs
