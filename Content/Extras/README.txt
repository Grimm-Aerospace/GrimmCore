Table of Contents
-----------------

BDBContractsFix - increases max simultaneous contracts, so that Apollo mission and others show up

BDBCryoTanks - replaces BDB boiloff with CryoTanks boiloff (now part of BDB)

BDBKerbalismScienceUpdate - adds (some) missing Kerbalism science definitions for BDB. Work in progress. Currently Keyhole and some other early satellites are supported (Nimbus, OGO) while ABTV experiments are broken by this patch.

CNCJNSQStations - adds CommNetConstellation ground station definitions for JNSQ. Now part of JNSQ. Known issues: 1) Do not change default Ground Station enable/disable settings in base/KK settings pages as it bugs out CNC. 2) Stock Kerbin DSN names appear in flight for some stations, this is just a visual issue and has no gameplay consequences.

Historian - my config for Historian (needs Historian, merge with its folder)

KFLateRepulsors - moves Kerbal Foundries repulsors to a new 4000 science node in Community Tech Tree

KPBSMKSCentrifuge - changes Kerbal Planetary Base Systems nuclear centrifuge to behave like the one in MKS

ShowAllTechTreeNodes - make sure to show all tech nodes regardless of other mods configs

USIB9TankTypes - B9PartSwitch tank types for USI mods. WIP

USIMalemuteB9Patch - 1.12+ wheels, B9 tanks for Malemute rover

====

1) add remaining experiments for BDB/Kerbalism
2) fix AGTV experiments and their overlap with non-AGTV
3) add MKS tank types for B9
4) convert remaining USI mods from FS to B9PS
